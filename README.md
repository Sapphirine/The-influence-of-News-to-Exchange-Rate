For this project, I scrape News data from the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times, implement NLP to vectorize the data,and train
the Bayesian Network with vectorized data. Then I compare the three different structure learning algorithms of the Bayesian Network 
training. By converting this problem to a prediction problem and cross-validation, the accuracy rate is 70%,71%,94% for score-based, 
constrain-based and hybrid algorithm. To evaluate the performance of Bayesian Network, I fit Naive Bayesian Classifier and Bayesian 
Neural Network, the relative accuracy rates are 63% and 79%
